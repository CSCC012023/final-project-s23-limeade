# GoGo / Limeade

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 27, 2023 (same meeting as the start of sprint 4)
 * Where: Online (Discord) (since Slack free version can’t have more than 2-3 people in VC)

## Process - Reflection

We finished most of the planned tasks and also added the unplanned task of updating CSS and UI, but didn't finish event search on the critical path.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 -----

* Assignment of tasks was done well — everyone worked together to complete their tasks on time (some related) and features were developed beyond the bare minimum requirements.



#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 -----

* Not everyone had major work to talk about in every standup so not all have a full five member contribution

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * No process related changes were made this sprint.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

* User chat [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-12)
* Event search and filtering [search](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-8) [filtering](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-21)
* Event recommendations based on interests [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-11)
* Staff login and features (moderation, reports) [staff features](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-20) [user reports story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-18)



#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

-----

* Unblocking users was initially a feature that was supposed to be implemented together with block users but was forgotten. This will be implemented in the next sprint to ensure fully functionality of the block feature. 


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

-----

 * Focus on finishing the rest of the user stories in our backlog.
 * Refine the application and enhance user experience. 
 * Finish core features to make the application fully functionable by the end of the last sprint.
