#### **Q1: What are you planning to build?**

GoGo is an application that connects users who want to share similar experiences. 

We are aiming to solve the issue of wanting to attend events and experiences but not knowing anyone
to attend with. This will also simulatenously solve a business issue of venues not being sold out,
and potential customers being lost due to them not having anyone to experience the event with. 

We are planning to build a website that will allow users to find each other based on
similar interests and being able to interact with one another and attend events together.
The center of connection will be the experience that the users want. Due to the growing 
trend of younger generations prioritizing doing what they want, regardless of who they do it with,
known as the Dazi phenonmemon, the app aims to capture this and have the connection rely on memorable 
experience rather then matching based on personality or friendships.

Users will be able to create experiences/events, invite others to their own, and join others as well.
Once users find others who want to share the experience, they will be able to interact and decide if they 
wish to go the event together.
