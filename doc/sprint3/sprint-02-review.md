# GoGo / Limeade

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 11, 2023 (same meeting as the start of sprint 3)
 * Where: Online (Discord) (since Slack free version canâ€™t have more than 2-3 people in VC)

## Process - Reflection

We finished most of the planned tasks and also added the unplanned task of updating CSS and UI, but didn't finish event search on the critical path.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 -----

* Deciding to add a UI story in the middle of the sprint so that the website is easier to navigate because the old one without styling was not particularly good for user experience (or to demo)
* Another good decision was picking the user stories that we did because they have the highest priority or are needed for future user stories, and most of them were completed on time


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 -----

* A decision that did not turn out well was not implementing reporting sooner. We should have implemented reporting users earlier to ensure the safety of future users while we were focused on blocking as well since it would not have taken much more additional effort, and any bugs could be caught early on in the development process
* A decision that did not turn out as well is not notifying teammates when we push changes to the development branch. We assumed that everybody checking for themselves would be easy and automatic but some complications came up in the merging process because when we pushed changes to development, teammates were not notified.
* A decision that did not turn out as well as we hoped is waiting very long to schedule the demo with our TA. This made for a lot of wasted time and confusion near the end of the sprint. We should schedule much beforehand to prevent this. 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Schedule the demo meeting earlier ahead of time in the first week to confirm

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

 -----

* Create user search [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-7)
* Create account settings [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-6)
* Add My Events component to user profiles and updated event details [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-24)
* Add personal information to user profiles [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-5)
* Add event join feature [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-10)
* add block user feature [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-19)
* cleaned up site formatting and UI [story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-25) (not originally planned)


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

-----

* Adding event search (moved to Sprint 3), there was not enough time to do so and it was dependent on other goals


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

-----

 * Making a better estimation to actually completing all user stories with better time management and work allocation
 * Thinking about and planning future deployment and CI/CD for upcoming Assignment 2
